# Contact Us Project

There are a lot of moving pieces in this application so we will break it into steps:

# The front end 

The front end is responsible for getting some data from the user. Once we get the data, we need to encrypt it to the task creatorâ€™s public address and host it on one of the task nodes running that task. To achieve this we need the following:
	
Task creator public address to encrypt data
Task nodes ip address to post the data to it

# The task node

The task nodes running the task are responsible for  holding the encrypted payload

# The back end 

The back end will retrieve the encrypted data from the task node, decrypt is using the private key of the task creator and viewing the data
